# Data analysis

This folder is where all the data analysis section will be performed. The version of Python being used is 3.11.9.

There is a problem with the `data` folder, as they are large files, it has been complicated to upload them here to the repository, however, as soon as a way is found, the files will be uploaded.

The links from where we extracted the data are the following:
